## bugs

- Below each row of images in the photo gallery section was a small white horizonatal gap.

- After research on Stackoverflow I found a fix. Giving each image a display: block; gets rid of the unwanted gap.

I visited the website on the GitHub pages link and some of the images would not load.

- After some research I was able to fix the issue by adjusting the src tag on the images. I removed the forward slash at the beginning.
