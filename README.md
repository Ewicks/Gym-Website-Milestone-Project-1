# Fitness Culture

Fitness Culture is a gym located in London that needs more customers to continue to increase monthly profits. I have created a website to help advertise Fitness Culture's gym, which will help spread awareness and increase the number of monthly memberships. People that visit the website will get a detailed insight to what they can expect if they join. The website will provide information such as; monthly membership prices, a motivational story and quote, location, meet the team section and how visitors can get in touch with Fitness Culture via a contact section.

## Features 

It's important that all pages are responsive on small, medium and large devices. Also that all pages are  
intuitively  designed to make it easy for the user to navigate.

### Home Page Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The navigation bar is located ontop of the background image to create a modern style navbar.

  - When the user hovers over a section, a white bar appears below to make it clear which section they are about to press.
  This is used in all pages of the website at the top for easy navigation.

- __Home Page__

  - The home page contains a large bold heading welcoming the user to Fitness Culture, this page's priority is to place the gym's name in the spotlight
  so that the user is more likely to remember Fitness Culture.

  - The background has a black gradient ontop of the image to create a larger contrast in color between the navbar and the background to make the white navbar stand out more.
